This app is used to demostrate how to connect mongodb in play 2.0 framework via morphia.

PS:Please inspect these three files, 
	app/models/Group.java,
	app/controllers/Application.java
	project/Build.scala

One more thing, after download the source code, do remember add the mongodb-java-driver and morphia jar files into the class path
